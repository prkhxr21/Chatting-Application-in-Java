Chatting Application README

Welcome to the Chatting Application!

This Java application was made in Apache Netbeans and allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. Below you will find information about the server and client components of the application.

## Server (Server.java):

The `Server` class facilitates communication between clients by handling incoming connections and distributing messages. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

- Provides a GUI interface for the server.
- Manages connections from multiple clients.
- Sends and receives messages between clients.
- Displays messages in a visually appealing format.

To run the server:
1. Import the given zip file in netbeans(import project Option)
2. Compile and execute the `Server.java` file.
3. Ensure the server is running before clients attempt to connect.

## Client (Client.java):

The `Client` class represents individual users of the application. Each client connects to the server to send and receive messages. Here's a summary of its features:

- Offers a graphical user interface for users to interact with.
- Connects to the server to send and receive messages.
- Displays messages in a visually appealing format.

To run the client:
1. Compile and execute the `Client.java` file.
2. Enter your message in the text field and click "Send" to transmit it to the server.
3. Receive messages from other clients displayed in the chat window.

## Getting Started:

1. Open the Java development environment of your choice (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse).
2. Import the code files into your IDE.
3. Compile and execute the `Server.java` file to start the server.
4. Compile and execute the `Client.java` file to start the client side.

## Usage:

1. Start the server by running the `Server.java` file.
2. Run multiple instances of the `Client.java` file to simulate multiple users.
3. Communicate with other users by typing messages in the client's GUI and pressing "Send".
4. After texting, click the back button on the top left corner of the window to close the application.
